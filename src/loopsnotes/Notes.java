	 * Loops
	 * # When we need to execute the block of code several times we used loop concept
	 * # loops are used to execute the set of code again and again
	 * 
	 * 1. ForLoop
	 * #for loop is used to iterate (retrieve) the part of program multiple time
	 * #If number of iteration is fixed
	 * # it is recommended to use the loop
	 * 
	 * syntax :-  	for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){
	 * 					//statement:- executable code
	 * }
	 * 
	 * e.x 		for(int i=o;i<5;i++){
	 * 			statement will execute
	 * 	}
	 * 
	 * 1. initialization
	 * # initialization always happen with primitive data type
	 * # it is initial condition which is executed when loop start
	 * # we can initialize the variable with data type ex. int i = 0;
	 * 
	 * 2. Condition
	 * # it is second condition which is executed each time to test the condition for the loop
	 * # it contains execution until the condition is false
	 * # it returns boolean value either true or false
	 * 
	 * 3. Statement:-
	 * # This statement of the loop is executed each time until the second is false
	 * 
	 * 4. Incre/decre
	 * # it increment/Decrement the variable value 
	 *
