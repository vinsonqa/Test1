	 * There are 4 type of conditional checking statement
	 * 1. If Else statement
	 * 2. If else if statement
	 * 3. Nested If else statement
	 * 4. Switch Statement
	 * 
	 * Generally we can use only If else statement and switch statement in the real scenarios
	 * 
	 * 1. If Else statement
	 * In the above condition there are checking the condition if the condition will true
	 * in if then its print the output in the console
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2. If Else Statement
	 * ## in the above condition there is on extra field is added called as elseif 
	 * ## checking the on condition in the multiple statement
	 * 
	 * 3. Nested If else statement
	 * //# It represent the if block within another if block
	 * //# Concept run on the  basis of inner and outer if block
	 * //# The Inner if block condition will be execute where outer if block condition is true 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 4. Switch Statement
	 * ## Switch statement is used to execute one statement from multiple statement
	 * Rules:-
	 * # There can be N number of case value for switch expression
	 * # The Case value must be switch expression type only:-
	 * 	The Case value must be case expression tye i.e. if we use integer then in case we use only integer
	 * 
	 * # The case value must be unique. In case of duplicate case value, it give compile time error
	 * 	 Same case will not added i.e if we created case 10 then we cannnot create 10 again as case
	 * 
	 * # Each case statement can have "break" statement
	 * 
	 * 
	 * # The case value can be "Default"label.
	 * 
	 * # If "break" statement is not found it will execute the next all statement

	 * MakePayment	AutoPayment	CreateANewAccount
	 * How we use switch expression here?
	 * 
	 * MakeAPayment		AutoPayment		CreateANewAccount
	 * 
	 * payment=MakeAPayment / AutoPayment / CreateANewAccount
	 * 
	 * switch(payment){

	 *	// Executable code
	 *	break;

	 * case "AutoPayment":
	 *	// Executable code
	 *	break;

	 *	// Executable code
